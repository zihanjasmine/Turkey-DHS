This repo analyzes the reasons for dropping out of school for women with different levels of education in Turkey in 1998 based on the Turkish Demographic and Health Survey Data. We found out that being unsupported by family is the main reason Turkey women quit school. We hope this article will raise awareness of the equal right to education between men and women.
